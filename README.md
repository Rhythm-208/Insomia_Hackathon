The Problem Statement
Proper management of academic and campus life for college students to
maintain balance, increase productivity, and capitalize on more
opportunities by eliminating clutter.
Theme Connection
As the theme tells about the distraction and overload of inputs
resulting in redundant use of time which as mentioned is ample,our
website enables students to manage all of these by arming them with
a powerful resource that provides for a more structured life at college.
Proposed Solution
The proposed solution is a calendar that uses color encoding based
on the type and timing of events. It is customized to the user and
follows the logic of the Eisenhower Matrix, where quadrants 1 and 2
contain important and high-priority events. It is more than just a
calendar; it features two modes: Study Mode and Campus Mode.
Study Mode focuses strictly on academic-related tasks and club
activities, while Campus Mode provides updates on fests, college
events, and other informal campus happenings.
